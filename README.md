# Web Server
A web server for handling general HTTP requests, built with sockets in Java.

# Function
This web server is able to respond properly to HTTP requests from client(web browser) and it can handle requests simultaneously. Java sockets are used to to accept string-format requests and return string-format responses. So, this Http Sever is implemented at very low level. It processes stand HTTP requests and responses all by hand.
